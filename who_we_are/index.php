            <p>With stemware, glasses, food storage and preserving jars, 
              and dinnerware gracing tables around the world, quality is the cornerstone in the foundation 
              that supports the Bormioli Rocco reputation. The plants where glass is produced, 
              located in Italy, France and Spain, are state of the art manufacturing facilities 
              that make use of the most up to date technology and economic sourcing of raw materials. 
              Efficiency and scale translate into value, so it is no surprise that in Italy, 
              Bormioli Rocco holds a 50% market share in the mass retail distribution channel for tableware. </p>
            <p>Market share cannot be maintained by resting on ones laurels. Every year, 
              the designers at Bormioli Rocco combine first hand trend research with the insights 
              garnered from the PeclersParis report, the industry standard for excellence in color 
              and design predictions, to stay ahead of the crowd with product innovations. 
              The report sets out a vision of future consumer values, attitudes, 
              lifestyles and aesthetic preferences as well as fashion, home design and color 
              trending. All are used as inspiration for color, shape and style forecasting, 
              the end result being new colors and shapes in the wine glasses, food containers 
              and tumblers that will end up on the tables and in the kitchens of modern homes everywhere.</p>
            <p>In the arena of cosmetic and perfume bottles, Bormioli Rocco supplies a true A-list of

          <div class="article_title w350">The History Of Man Making Glass</div>
          <div class="article_body w640 fleft">
            <p>Truth be told, Mother Nature made the first glass: obsidian, 
              the glisteningly black igneous rock formed when lava quickly cooled millions of years ago. 
              Used to create spearheads by Stone Age hunters, it was traded, protected and treasured. 
              Man stepped in and began creating glass to order around 5,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, 
              the area that lies between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is now Syria, Iran and Iraq. 
              Some of the first known glass objects were beads, with glasses, plates and carafes not showing 
              up on the scene until about 1,200 years later. The earliest pieces used for food storage 
              were made one of two ways: either coils of hot molten glass built up on a form in a process 
              similar to coil built pottery, or carved from solid blocks using the same techniques familiar 
              to artisans accustomed to carving stone. </p>
            <p>A few hundred years later, glass production moved beyond its area of origin. 
              Archeologists have discovered artifacts in Crete, Egypt and Western Asia. 
              Typically found associated with royal palaces and estates, glass was a luxury and it is 
              speculated that the "recipe" was a closely guarded secret. </p>
            <p>By the 6th century BCE, artisans had codified the steps used to produce glass on stone tablets. 
              Techniques used for the next few hundred years were similar in many cultures and produced utilitarian objects. 
              In addition, glass tiles were created and used in the decorative arts.  
              By the first century CE, the industry changed dramatically with the discovery of glass blowing. 
              For the first time, a faster method of creating vessels was available and glass, 
              though still a luxury item, was more readily available. </p>
            <p>Traded around the world, there is evidence of Roman glass making it's way to China before the common era, 
              but production being ramped up with blown glass is the beginning of it taking off as a real industry. </p>

          <div class="article_title w310">The History OF Italian Glass</div>
          <div class="article_body w640 fleft">
            <p>For several hundreds of years after the first century, 
              most glass making rolled along with pretty much the same number of advances across what is now Europe.  
              There is archeological evidence from the 6th century supporting the evidence of glass making in Venice, 
              primarily tiles used decoratively and as a means to bring light into bath houses. Venice's unique geographic 
              location on the Adriatic as the "land and water bridge" between what is now Italy and the Near East meant it was 
              the center of an enormous amount of trade, both land and sea based. This gave the local glass artisans the advantage 
              of a huge customer base, and Venice dominated in glass production for hundreds of years. In addition, 
              Venetians were the first to experience the advanced glass techniques being used in the East. During the 
              Crusades, many Byzantine glass artists immigrated to Venice and set up shop. Glass became a major economic force, 
              so much so that in the late 13th century the Republic of Venice decreed that no foreign glass could be imported and 
              foreign glassmakers were no longer allowed to set up shop in the republic.</p>
            <p>Around this time, the mainly wooden glass shops were considered a fire hazard and all glass making 
              operations were moved to the island of Murano, just off the coast of Venice. 
              This edict was a bit of a sham, as the main reasoning behind the move was to isolate the 
              glassmakers from the rest of the world and vice versa. No secrets out, no spies in, and, later, 
              no glassmakers allowed to move off the island. The powers that be in Venice were very serious 
              about their glass. As in all towns, the glass artisans were part of a guild, the trade union/secret society of the time.</p>
            <p>In addition to Murano, Altare, just off the Mediterranean coast of the Italian Riviera 
              became the other great glass city if Italy. Legend has it that in the 11th century a 
              hermit was so impressed with the wood on the coast that he convinced some families to 
              establish the area as a glass-making center. The Bormioli family was among them, and thus a dynasty was born.</p>
