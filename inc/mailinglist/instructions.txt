Installation:
=======
0. Open constants.php and edit the MySQL credentials.
1. Upload the following files to your website via FTP, SSH or another method: admin.php, constants.php, index.php, styles.css, update.php
2. Open PHPMyAdmin and create a new database
3. In the new database, import the subscribers.sql file
4. Open your browser and go to urlpath/admin.php (Edit url path to the url location of where the files were uploaded)
5. Login with username "admin@test.com" and password "password"
6. You are now viewing the admin panel. You may edit the account to change the name (currently set to "Admin"), the password (currently set to "password") and the email (currently set to "admin@test.com")


=======
Notes:
=======
- All the alerts and messages you see are all available to edit in the constants.php file
- The system can be themed by editing the css in the styles.css file
- The mailing list is very light-weight so it's easy to put it anywhere. If you would like it to appear on your website's sidebar or something like that, open up index.php and copy everything inbetween the <body> tags and paste it whereever you want the system to appear.
- It is recommended that you keep the admin.php url secret. That's just for you to secretly send newsletters and so on. All that you need to display is the index.php (which can be renamed to anything else by the way)
- The newsletter textbox accepts HTML. Format all your newsletters in HTML
- Every 20 emails, the system will pause for 3 seconds to take a break and then it will send 20 more, pause again and so on. This is prevent your server from crashing. If 20 emails is too much, you can edit the configuration in the constants.php file
